<h1 id="polyglot_xh">Polyglot_XH</h1>
<p>Polyglot_XH offers advanced features for multilingual CMSimple_XH websites. The main point is that it allows to mark individual pages of different languages as actual translations, so visitors as well as the admin can quickly switch between the translations of a certain page.</p>
<p>Furthermore the plugin automatically emits information mainly for search engines regarding available translations of the current page (so called <a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/189077?hl=en">hreflang links</a>).</p>

<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
<p>Polyglot_XH is a plugin for CMSimple_XH. It requires CMSimple_XH ≥ 1.7.0 with the <a href="https://github.com/cmb69/plib_xh">Plib_XH plugin</a> and PHP ≥ 7.1.0.</p>
<h2 id="download">Download</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/cmb69/polyglot_xh/releases/latest">lastest release</a> is available for download on Github.</p>
<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<p>The installation is done as with many other CMSimple_XH plugins.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Backup the data on your server.</li>
<li>Unzip the distribution on your computer.</li>
<li>Upload the whole directory <code>polyglot/</code> to your server into the <code>plugins/</code> directory of CMSimple_XH.</li>
<li>Give write permissions to the subdirectories <code>cache/</code>, <code>config/</code>, <code>css/</code> and <code>languages/</code>.</li>
<li>Go to <code>Plugins</code> → <code>Polyglot</code> in the back-end to check if all requirements are fulfilled.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="settings">Settings</h2>
<p>The configuration of the plugin is done as with many other CMSimple_XH plugins in the back-end of the website. Go to <code>Plugins</code> → <code>Polyglot</code>.</p>
<p>You can change the default settings of Polyglot_XH under <code>Config</code>. Hints for the options will be displayed when hovering over the help icon with your mouse.</p>
<p>Localization is done under <code>Language</code>. You can translate the character strings to your own language (if there is no appropriate language file available), or customize them according to your needs.</p>
<p>The look of Polyglot_XH can be customized under <code>Stylesheet</code>.</p>
<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<p>To use the advanced language menu of Polyglot_XH replace the call to <code>languagemenu()</code> in your template(s) with:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php echo polyglot_languagemenu()?&gt;</code></pre>
<p>To make this actually work, you have to tag individual pages of different languages appropriately. You can do this in the tab <code>Polyglot</code> above the content editor; simply set the same unique tag for the original page and for its translations.</p>
<p>In the plugin administration (<code>Plugins</code> → <code>Polyglot</code> → <code>Translations</code>) you can get an overview of which pages are already translated. The page headings as well as the translations are linked to the respective pages in edit mode, so you can quickly repair possibly missing Polyglot_XH tags.</p>
<p>Note that the relations between pages of different languages are cached in <code>plugins/polyglot/cache/</code> for performance reasons. If you have to clear this cache for whatever reason, you have to save at least one page of <strong>every</strong> language to rebuilt it properly.</p>
